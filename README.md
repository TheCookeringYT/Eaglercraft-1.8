How to make it work -----> Step 1: Next to "Insights" there should be a button called "Settings" next to it. If you clicked on it scroll until it says pages.------> Step 2: Under were it says branch there should be 2 buttons. One of them says "None" and the other says "Save".------> Step 3: Click the "None" button and click "Main" if its not there click "Master" then click "Save" AND DO NOT CHANGE "/root" AT ALL!-------> Step 4: After it finishes your website or Github Page it should say 404 Error, now at the URL and type EaglercraftX_1.8_u53_Offline_Signed.html and it should say https://(Your or my name).github.io/Eaglercraft-1.8/EaglercraftX_1.8_u53_Offline_Signed.html. Refresh and now you have Eaglercraft 1.8.8!-------------------------------->
Oh yeah you have to Fork it.
